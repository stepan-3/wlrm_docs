# How Wallarm Sidecar Container Works

Wallarm WAF node installs as a sidecar container to the same pod as the main application container. The WAF node filters incoming requests and forwards valid requests to the application container.

Kubernetes runs the sidecar container alongside the main container image. The sidecar container also shares the same lifecycle as the main application container, being created and retired alongside it.

## Traffic Flow

Normally Kubernetes uses a `Service` object with the `ClusterIP` or `NodePort` type to be exposed directly to the Internet or other Kubernetes applications. The following are examples of traffic flow for architecture with such `Service` object without Wallarm sidecar container and with it.

### Scheme of the traffic flow without Wallarm sidecar container

An application container accepts incoming requests on port `8080/TCP` and the `Service` object forwards incoming requests to the same port (`8080/TCP`) on all healthy pods of the application (Kubernetes `Deployment` object).

### Scheme of the traffic flow with Wallarm sidecar container

An application container accepts incoming requests on port `8080/TCP` and the `Service` object forwards incoming requests to another port (for example, `80/TCP`) on Wallarm sidecar container. Wallarm sidecar container filters requests and forwards the valid ones to the `8080/TCP` port on all healthy pods of the application (Kubernetes `Deployment` object).

When a Wallarm WAF node sidecar container is added to a Kubernetes pod it is necessary to change the flow of HTTP requests hitting the pod. The detailed description of changing is provided in the instructions.
