The filtering and proxying rules are configured in the `/etc/nginx-wallarm/conf.d/wallarm.conf` file.

You can create your own configuration files to define the operation of NGINX-Wallarm. It is recommended to create a separate configuration file with the `server` block for each group of the domains that should be processed in the same way.

To see detailed information about configuring NGINX-Wallarm, proceed to the [official NGINX documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html).

Wallarm directives define the operation logic of the Wallarm filter node. To see the list of Wallarm directives available, proceed to the [Wallarm configuration options](/admin-en/configure-parameters-en.md) page.

#### A Configuration File Example

Let us suppose that you need to configure the server to work in the following conditions:
* Only HTTP traffic is processed. There are no HTTPS requests processed.
* The following domains receive the requests: `example.com` and `www.example.com`.
* All requests must be passed to the server `10.80.0.5`.
* All incoming requests are considered less than 1MB in size (default setting).
* The processing of a request takes no more than 60 seconds (default setting).
* Wallarm must operate in the monitor mode.
* Clients access the filter node directly, without an intermediate HTTP load balancer.

!!! info "Creating a configuration file"
    You can create a custom NGINX-Wallarm configuration file (e.g. `example.com.conf`) or modify the default NGINX-Wallarm configuration file (`default.conf`).
    
      When creating a custom configuration file, make sure that NGINX-Wallarm listens to the incoming connections on the free port.


To meet the listed conditions, the contents of the configuration file must be the following:

```

    server {
      listen 80;
      listen [::]:80 ipv6only=on;

      # the domains for which traffic is processed
      server_name example.com; 
      server_name www.example.com;

      # turn on the monitoring mode of traffic processing
      wallarm_mode monitoring; 
      # wallarm_instance 1;

      location / {
        # setting the address for request forwarding
        proxy_pass http://10.80.0.5; 
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      }
    }

```
