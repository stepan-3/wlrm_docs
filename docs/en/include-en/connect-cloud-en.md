!!! info "API Access"
    The API choice for your filter node depends on the Cloud you are using. Please, select the API accordingly:
    * If you are using <https://my.wallarm.com/>, your node requires access to `https://api.wallarm.com:444`.
    * If you are using <https://us1.my.wallarm.com/>, your node requires access to `https://us1.api.wallarm.com:444`.

    Ensure the access is not blocked by a firewall.

The filter node interacts with the Wallarm cloud. 

To connect the node to the cloud using your cloud account requisites, proceed with the following steps:

1.  Make sure that your Wallarm account has the Administrator role enabled and two-factor authentication disabled, therefore allowing you to connect a filter node to the cloud. 
     
    You can check the aforementioned parameters by navigating to the user account list in the Wallarm console.

        * If you are using <https://my.wallarm.com/>, proceed to the [following link][link-wl-console-users-eu] to check your user settings.
        * If you are using <https://us1.my.wallarm.com/>, proceed to the [following link][link-wl-console-users-us] to check your user settings.

    !!! info 
        You have to pick the script to run depending on the Cloud you are using.
        * If you are using <https://my.wallarm.com/>, run the script from the «EU Cloud» tab below.
        * If you are using <https://us1.my.wallarm.com/>, run the script from the «US Cloud» tab below.
    
    === "EU Cloud"
    /usr/share/wallarm-common/addnode

    === "US Cloud"
    /usr/share/wallarm-common/addnode -H us1.api.wallarm.com
    
    To specify the name of the created node, use the `-n <node name>` option.

3.  Provide your Wallarm account’s login and password when prompted.
