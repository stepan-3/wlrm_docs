    >   #### Info:: About the gRPC Protocol
    >
    >   gRPC is a modern open-source high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) [framework][link-grpc-docs] from Google.
    >
    >   Its high performance is achieved through the use of [HTTP/2][link-http2-docs] for transport and [protobuf][link-protobuf-docs] for data type descriptions.
    >   
    >   The gRPC protocol can be used as an alternative to the REST when building APIs and services.
