#   The “Scanner” Dashboard

This dashboard provides you with information about vulnerabilities detected by the scanner.

When working with this dashboard, you can choose the date range you are interested in (default choice: one month prior to the current date). This choice influences all information on the dashboard.

![The “Scanner” dashboard][img-dashboard]

Available statistics are:
*   the number of vulnerabilities of all risk levels in the current month
*   the number of vulnerabilities of all risk levels that were not fixed by the end of the chosen date range
*   changes in the numbers of vulnerabilities of all risk levels for the whole chosen date range

Click one of the pie charts with a vulnerabilities number on the right to be redirected to the [*Events* tab][doc-events-tab]. The table on this tab will contain unfixed vulnerabilities of the chosen risk level in the selected time range.
