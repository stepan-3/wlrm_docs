# Subscriptions

The *Subscriptions* tab of the *Settings* section allows users to view the status of their current subscriptions.

![Subscriptions overview][img-subscriptions]

The *Subscriptions* tab provides the following information:
*   Name of the subscription and its status
*   Subscription expiration date
*   Quota usage and limits, if a quota is set for a subscription
*   Request statistics: the average number of requests (monthly)
*   List of the modules included in the subscription and additional information about each of them

## Viewing Information About a Quota  

The information about a monthly request quota is displayed right under the subscription's name:
*   “Unlimited,” if no quota is set
*   data about limits, if a quota is set

To modify the existing quota limits, [contact Wallarm Support][anchor-contact-support].


##  Viewing Request Statictics

Monthly statistics are displayed under the “Monthly requests average” value.

Click the *“View full usage history”* link to open a pop-up window containing the full statistics.

In this window, you can sort the content either by the month or number of requests. To sort table entries, click the corresponding column.
