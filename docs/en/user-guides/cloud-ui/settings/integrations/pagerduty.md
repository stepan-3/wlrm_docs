#   PagerDuty Notifications

You can set up Wallarm to send notifications to PagerDuty.

Notifications can be set up for the following events:

*   System-related:
    *   New user creation
    *   Integration settings change
*   Vulnerability detection
*   Network perimeter change

##  Setting up Notifications

In PagerDuty you can [set up an integration][link-pagerduty-docs] for any existing service or create a new service specifically for Wallarm:

1. Go to *Configuration* â†’ *Services*.

2. Select an existing service by clicking its name to set up an integration for it or create a new service by clicking the *New service* button.

3. Create a new integration.

    *   If you are configuring integrations of the existing service, go to the *Integrations* tab and click the *New Integration* button.
    *   If you are creating a new service, enter the desired name for it into the *Name* field and proceed to the *Integration Settings* section.

4. Enter the desired name of the integration into the *Integration name* field (e.g. `Wallarm Integration`) and select the *Use our API directly* option as an integration type.

    *   If you are configuring integrations of the existing service, click the *Add Integration button*.
    *   If you are creating a new service, configure the rest of the settings sections and click the *Add Service* button.
    <br><br>
    
5. Copy the *Integration Key* that corresponds to the new integration. It will be used later to create an integration on the Wallarm console.

To create a PagerDuty integration on the Wallarm console, perform the following actions:

1. Go to the *Integrations* tab of the *Settings*.

2. Click the *PagerDuty* block or click the *Add integration* button and choose *PagerDuty*.
