# Deleting Triggers

To stop sending notifications and reactions to events permanently, you can delete the trigger. To disable the trigger temporarily, you can [disable](disable-trigger.md) the trigger.

Triggers are deleted in your Wallarm account > the **Triggers** section via the **Delete** button. The section is available only for users with the **Administrator** role.

Deleting a trigger cannot be undone. The trigger will be removed from the trigger list permanently.
